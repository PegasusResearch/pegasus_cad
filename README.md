# Pegasus CAD Model

This repository contains the CAD model of the Pegasus quadrotors. The model was designed using Onshape and is available in step and stl formats.

There are two models available:

- **Version 2 (2024-2025):** The second version of the Pegasus quadrotor. This version has a carbon fiber frame and 3D printed parts. It was developed to be safer for flights near people.
